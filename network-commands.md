Here's a breakdown of when to use each, plus a few others that are super handy for network troubleshooting:

**Basic Network Diagnostics**

* **`ping`**:  Use this to test basic connectivity to another host (like a website or server). It sends ICMP echo requests and waits for replies. This helps determine if the host is reachable and how long it takes to get a response.

   ```b
   ping google.com 
   ```

* **`traceroute` (or `tracert` on Windows)**: When you want to see the path your network packets take to reach a destination. Useful for diagnosing network slowdowns or outages as it shows you each hop along the way and the time it takes.

   ```
   traceroute google.com
   ```

**DNS Lookups**

* **`dig` (Domain Information Groper)**: A powerful tool for querying DNS servers. Use it to troubleshoot DNS problems, get detailed information about domain names (like IP addresses, MX records, etc.), and diagnose DNS propagation issues.

   ```
   dig google.com 
   dig google.com MX  
   ```

* **`nslookup`**: Another tool for DNS queries, but `dig` is generally preferred these days as it's more versatile and provides more detailed output.

   ```
   nslookup google.com
   ```

**Working with Network Services**

* **`curl`**:  A versatile tool for transferring data to or from a server using various protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, etc.). Great for testing web servers, downloading files, and interacting with APIs.

   ```
   curl https://www.google.com 
   curl -I https://www.google.com  # Get headers only
   ```

* **`wget`**:  Primarily for downloading files from the web. Simpler to use than `curl` for basic downloads.

   ```
   wget https://www.example.com/somefile.zip
   ```

* **`telnet`**: Used to test connectivity to a specific port on a remote host.  Helpful for checking if a service (like a web server on port 80 or an email server on port 25) is running.

   ```
   telnet google.com 80 
   ```

* **`nc` (netcat)**: A powerful networking tool with many uses, including port scanning, file transfer, and creating simple network servers.

   ```
   nc -zv google.com 80  # Check if port 80 is open
   ```

**Other Important Commands**

* **`ipconfig` (Windows) or `ifconfig` (Linux/macOS)**: Displays network interface configuration details (IP address, subnet mask, MAC address, etc.). Essential for troubleshooting network connection problems.

   ```
   ipconfig /all  # Windows 
   ifconfig -a    # Linux/macOS
   ```

* **`netstat`**: Shows active network connections, listening ports, routing tables, and network interface statistics. Useful for identifying which applications are using network resources and diagnosing connection issues.

   ```
   netstat -a 
   netstat -an  # Show numerical addresses
   ```

* **`route`**:  Used to view and manipulate the IP routing table. You can use it to add, delete, or modify routes.

   ```
   route print  # Windows
   route -n     # Linux/macOS
   ```

* **`arp`**: Displays the ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) cache, which maps IP addresses to MAC addresses. Useful for identifying devices on your local network and troubleshooting address resolution issues.

   ```
   arp -a
   ```

**Important Notes:**

* The availability and specific options of these commands might vary slightly depending on your operating system (Windows, Linux, macOS).
* Use the `man` command (e.g., `man ping`) or the `--help` option (e.g., `ping --help`) to get detailed information about each command and its options.
* For more advanced network analysis, consider tools like `tcpdump` (packet capture) or `Wireshark` (network protocol analyzer).
