    * How a website works (`www.example.com`)
    * DNS lookup process
    * ARP process
    * TCP connection establishment
    * HTTP request/response cycle
    * HTTPS and TLS/SSL

* **parsing_log_files.md:**  A guide to parsing log files with Python, covering:
    * Extracting data from log files
    * Analyzing log data (e.g., counting status codes per minute)
    * Using regular expressions for pattern matching
    * Exporting parsed data to files
    * Working with APIs (making requests, handling JSON, pagination)
    * Directory traversal
    * Writing data to CSV files

* **network_layers_and_protocols.md:** A table summarizing the 7 layers of the OSI model, including:
    * Layer names and functions
    * Protocols associated with each layer
    * Data units (bits, frames, packets, segments, etc.)

* **network_commands.md:** A guide to essential network command-line tools for troubleshooting and diagnostics, including:
    * `ping`
    * `traceroute`
    * `dig`
    * `nslookup`
    * `curl`
    * `wget`
    * `telnet`
    * `nc` (netcat)
    * `ipconfig`/`ifconfig`
    * `netstat`
    * `route`
    * `arp` 

## How to Use

* Review the cheatsheet and guides to refresh EE281 midterm concepts.
* Use the code examples as a starting point for solving network-related programming tasks.
* yea, thats it.. gl
